Routing engine to be used with Maritime to enable Express style routing. Maritime has been created to allow different routing engines to be used for different routing syntaxs. An engine must handle creating regexp, matching routes and creating route parameters. All extra data that could be used later (such as route keys or the regexp match data) should be stored on the engine object.
